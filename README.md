How it works?
After the Extension is installed, follow steps below to use Extension:
A. ReadAssist through right-click and select "ReadAssist -Click to Enable"
1. Right-click on the web page you are and click "ReadAssist -Click to Enable".
2. This opens a new ReadAssist tab. Click Start button here, keep tab open and go back to web page.
3. In the web page now click any word for which you need English meaning/synonym.
4. It opens a modal/synonym popup with synonym while the word is captured with English meaning in the ReadAssist tab.
5. Click anywhere outside modal/synonym popup to close it. You can keep clicking for as many words you need.
6. If you find any issues, please report us.
B. ReadAssist through word select and click "Get Quick Synonym: "
1. In the web page in your browser, highlight and select specific word for which you seek meaning.
2. Now right click the highlighted word, let's say "Hello" and click "Get Quick Synonym: Hello".
3. You would get a new ReadAssist tab with word meaning for the first time. Keep this tab open.
4. Go back to your browser page, highlight with mouse select any other word and click "Get Quick Synonym:".
5. You would get modal/synonym popup with synonym while the word is captured with English meaning in the ReadAssist tab.

2. Click Disable button for the Extension to stop using it. 

Future work:
1. Your feedback and suggestions to improve would be of highest priority.
2. Feedback from student communities who might find it very useful would be highly appreciated.
3. We are planning to build this tool with an option to select synonyms interactively and replace words 
in your actual web page for ease of reading.
4. Also a feature to select entire page or portion of webpage with replaced synonyms/words as a note to 
your e-mail address is a work in progress.
5. Adding intelligence based on word clicked in a specific sentence would actually fetch accurate synonyms. 
Such intelligence has to resolve word context of whether it was used as noun, verb, adjective, etc based on 
the sentence. This level of accuracy in word meaning prediction is a work in progress.
6. If you find an Enterprise or Commercial use of this tool and its features, please feel free to contact us 
at www.readassist@gmail.com. We would make every effort to address your queries asap.
7. Last but not the least, give us stars in Github and Chrome Store if you liked what we did. :)
